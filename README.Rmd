## Getting started

At this point I’m assuming you received an invitation to view an assignment on
github classroom and accepted it. You now have a private repository of these files.
This repository contains starter code for all assignments.  

To start working on an assignment, open RStudio (on your desktop or cloudserver). 
Select file, new project, Version control. On the next screen select git. Next 
you’ll need to enter the url for your repository. Look for the Code button 
(usually green) in your githbub repository (where you may be reading this...).

Click it, then copy the 
web url (or click the copy icon). Input that into the Rstudio Repository URL 
space. Then name the project (maybe Assignment 1,2, etc?). The Create project… 
field can be left blank to just save all projects into the main directory.
Alternatively you can click Browse and make an Assignments folder if you want.
Whatever you choose, the project will be saved in new folder in that location 
using the name you chose.

Now you can start working on the assignment in Rstudio.  To view instructions, 
open the .Rmd file you want on IN RSTUDIO! It will be in the folder for the assignment
you are focusing on.  Then **Knit** the file.

Presto! You will
see instructions. As you update the .Rmd file and **Knit** it, it will update. Make
sure you also save changes and **Commit** and **Push** them back to the github clone!  

This is the file you will eventually turn in (a little meta...).  You can also view 
the instructions/assignment file on Github if you click on the .md file in the 
folder associated with the assignment you are working on.
