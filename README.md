## Getting started

At this point I’m assuming you received the invitation to view the
assignment on github classroom and accepted it. You now have a private
repository of these files.

To start working on the assignment, open RStudio (on your desktop or
cloudserver). Select file, new project, Version control. On the next
screen select git. Next you’ll need to enter the url for your
repository. Look for the Code button (usually green) in your githbub
repository (where you may be reading this…). Click it, then copy the web
url (or click the copy icon). Input that into the Rstudio Repository URL
space. Then name the project (maybe Assignment 1,2, etc?). The Create
project… field can be left blank to just save all projects into the main
directory. Alternatively you can click Browse and make an Assignments
folder if you want. Whatever you choose, the project will be saved in
new folder in that location using the name you chose.

Now you can start working on the assignment in Rstudio. To view
instructions, open the .Rmd file you want on IN RSTUDIO\! and **Knit**
the file. Presto\! You will see instructions. As you update the .Rmd
file and **Knit** it, it will update. Make sure you also save changes
and **Commit** and **Push** them back to the github clone\!

This is the file you will eventually turn in (a little meta…). You can
also view the instructions/assignment file on Github if you click on the
.md file in the folder associated with the assignment you are working
on.
